# DiscordJS_Template
Hey guys! Thought I would add the template I use for whenever I start a new bot. It has a simple command handler and example command! Join the Discord Server for help with this!

Step 1) 

  Download or git pull the files to your local machine.
  
  
Step 2) 
  
  Change token in config.json file
  
Step 3) 

  Add your own commands and have fun!
